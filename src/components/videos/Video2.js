                <p>BOB SINCLAIR
                    WORLD HOLD ON 

                    <br/>

                    Christophe Le Friant or Bob Sinlar as he is 
                    worldwide known a famous French DJ. He became
                    popular for commercializing the French touch
                    of house music with emphasized use of sampled
                    and filtered disco strings. His music style 
                    can be described as inspired by love and 
                    peace. The optimistic tone prevails in all
                    his vibrant songs and World Hold On is not
                    the exception to the rule. The song’s 
                    opening stanza is emphasizing the moment 
                    of crucial importance and that is people
                    to become awakened and to open their
                    hearts and let the feelings in. In this 
                    modern and consumer living it is evident 
                    that humanity lost empathy. People are into 
                    satisfying their own needs and being nothing 
                    more than selfish. Bob is also mentioning 
                    the Big Bang, not as if something that 
                    happened millions years ago and that is 
                    the expansion of space, but a kind of 
                    reminder that in this modern and technology 
                    dominated world, soon there would be no free 
                    space for nature and things to evolve. Bob is 
                    saying to the world to hold on, be optimistic 
                    but also make an action. Our future is on stake 
                    and we should be honest and use no lies or spin in 
                    the media to cover up things or in the eyes of the 
                    public to make things look great. Everything that is 
                    being placed under the rug and neglected due to the 
                    interest of a powerful group of people should be 
                    revealed, because everyone is going to answer the 
                    “children of the sky”, the angels or also the future 
                    generations that are coming. We should all turn inward 
                    and look inside of us, observe the call of the soul, 
                    a deeper love that comes from the Divine. The inner 
                    child that sleeps in every one of use should be 
                    cherished and protected, since those noble things 
                    should be the values upon which the new humane 
                    society is based on.
