                THE FIXX - DRIVEN OUT
                <br/>
                The Fixx  is a British rock band from London, founded in 1979 by college friends Cy Curnin doing the vocals and Adam Woods on drums who by the way were initially called Portraits. The band later on got enlarged with the keyboardist Rupert Greenall, guitarist Tony McGrail and the bassist Russel Mckenzie who was later on replaced by Chralie Barrett.  The band's major hits include "One Thing Leads to Another", "Saved by Zero", "Are We Ourselves?", and "Secret Separation", all of which made the U.S. Top 20, as well as early MTV Video hits "Red Skies" and "Stand or Fall" and mainstream rock chart hits "Driven Out" and "Deeper and Deeper", the latter of which was featured on the soundtrack of the 1984 film Streets of Fire. Driven Out is a song that can be taken as an excellent criticism towards society. The strong message in the first line hints the tone and the message of the song. Rulers, politicians, capitalists, presidents of countries are ripping of societies, the planet and natural resources for their own interest. Threes are being cut down, forests ruined, due to profit oriented people we all pay the price. Our souls are empty, the spirits vague like we do not have empathy and values that we hold on to in life. Those who are on the margins live silent lives. The people who share the opinion of Cy Curnin and I would add the majority of sane people would put into his shoes when he describes that he used to have normal life, but not anymore. He used to be able to sleep at night, seems that the deteriorated behavior disturbed him. Living a life on a higher pace, using the microwave for heating up already made meals instead of cooking nice and healthy meals is a normal routine. With the pace how things are today, we might not be able to see a fertile soil aor arable piece of land to grow grains and make food. As the tone approaches the end of the song, the author vowed a dosage of optimism. Let’s hope that we will escape the grind and create life with values, with deep sense. Let’s hope that we will leave pride and selfishness behind. Let’s hope for e better tomorrow. Let’s come the other way round, for better, for all of us.
