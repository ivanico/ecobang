                SECOND NATURE - RUSH
                    <br/>
                    Rush is rock band formed in Canada in 1968 and it us well known for its complex compositions and kind of eclectic themes inspired from SF, fantasy, philosophy and politics. The music style of the band itself changed during the years from blues hard rock in the very beginning, moving to progressive rock. While listening to “Second nature” lots of thoughts and ideas come to mind. The general sense that prevails is strong criticism to leaders, government officials and societies in terms where we stand now. To begin with, the first stanza brings the focus immediately the most responsible people that is the leaders and their offices and cabinets, the kings and God as well regarding the second nature or the place, the space where we dwell in. It is strong criticism about human reluctance and insensitiveness. It is obvious that progress has to be made and it should be done as soon as possible, despite the “being busy” mode we all are and perhaps not willing to face the reality and improve things. The collective irresponsibility is being criticized, that is the folks who have to make choices by voting, by electing their representatives wisely who are about the make pave the changes for a better tomorrow. As the song goes deeper and as we get to the 8th stanza, in January 1994 The Rush Backstage Club newsletter, drummer and also lyricist Neil Peart gave an explanation about the line “Now lay me down in dreamland”. That is based on an 18th century bedtime prayer for children. Peart said that it is more a paraphrase that a quote, since it stemmed from a prayer which was stitched into a sampler above his grandmother’s bed. It began like this:” Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep”. One of the critics regarding this song which actually hit the core says: “Second Nature is conciliatory in its message: “If we cannot reach perfection in this world then let’s at least settle for some degree of improvement. Sometimes we have to accept something less than total victory. It is like the difference between compromise and balance. The politician who campaigns for clean but does not want to close down the stinking factory in his area because thousands of workers will lose their jobs. The strong moral is to take actually as much as one can, without hurting other people. The last stanza refers again to the political leaders or “the captains” who obviously keep on steering people in the wrong direction. Wake up people!
